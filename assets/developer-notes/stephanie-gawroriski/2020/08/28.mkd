So it is the weekend again which means I can spend time on SquirrelJME
potentially. Taking things a bit easy, so naturally will have slow progress
as this week was busy. I got more books on ancient hardware so that will be
very useful for when I do retro ports. I also did some thinking about ROM
stripping to make it as tiny as possible, since that would be important.
