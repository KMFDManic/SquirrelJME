I feel rather well, I have less distractions and such so I can work on
SquirrelJME and relax like I used to when developing. I know I have not
really been keeping up with all the notes, but progress is going well.

For `List` I think for the icons I can just use paint and otherwise to grab an
image for them. At least use that to figure out how to actually draw icon
images. Is the only way I can think of that would allow them to be set using
the existing code.
